# Addon

## Do I need a separate license for each addon?

Yes, you need to purchase separate licenses for each addon. Please refer to our pricing page: <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/store/dynamic-web-twain/" target="_blank">Dynamic Web Twain Pricing - Dynamsoft</a>.

Multiple license keys can be separated with semicolons and included in the file dynamsoft.webtwain.config.js.

Starting in Dynamic Web TWAIN 17.0, we added a new licensing mode for the Per Client Device license. By setting an organizationID/Handshake Code, the application does not need to change if multiple license items are added.

Please check [here](/_articles/about/license.md){:target="_blank"} for more information on licenses and <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/license-server/docs/about/terms.html#organization-id" target="_blank">here</a> for Organization ID and Handshake Code.
