## Can I add annotation to an image (e.g. add watermark or text)?

In 2023, Dynamsoft introduced Dynamsoft Document Viewer, a feature-rich web-based document viewer that supports document annotation. When used in conjunction with Dynamic Web TWAIN, it enables users to annotate scanned documents seamlessly. For more information, please refer to: [Dynamic Web TWAIN with Annotations](https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/faq/dwt-with-annotation.html).
