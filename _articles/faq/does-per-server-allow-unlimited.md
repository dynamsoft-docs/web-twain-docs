# Licensing and Purchase

## Does the per-server license allow unlimited number of client devices and end users?

Yes. With per server license, you get an unlimited number of client devices and end users.
Note that every VM or machine (either a server or workstation) that hosts the web app needs a 1-server license seat.

If your application is a commercial cloud service, the per-server license may not be applicable. Please submit your requirement via <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/ask-for-quote/" target="_blank">this quote form</a> to our sales team so we can provide proper licensing option to fit in your need.
