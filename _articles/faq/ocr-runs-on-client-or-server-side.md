# Addon

## Does your OCR addon run on the client side or server side?

OCR Basic is a light-weight OCR engine that works with the scanning module of Dynamic Web TWAIN on the client-side. While it can run on the server-side, it's not recommended due to performance.

OCR Pro is a heavyweight OCR engine and is mostly deployed to the server side due to its size, but server-side OCR Pro is no longer supported since version 17.0. However, we provide OCR Pro client-side addon if that's desired. Note that client-side OCR Pro requires a trackable license. The traditional product key no longer works.
