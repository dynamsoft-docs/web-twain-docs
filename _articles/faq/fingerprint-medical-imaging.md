# Capture/Image Source

## Do you support fingerprint or medical imaging devices?

The Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK works with any TWAIN specification compatible devices including fingerprint devices.
However, there are not many fingprint devices that provide TWAIN drivers. You can refer to <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/blog/insights/biometric-capture-fingerprint-application/" target="_blank">this blog</a> for some info.

For medical imaging devices, DICOM is a common specification, which is not supported by our Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK.
