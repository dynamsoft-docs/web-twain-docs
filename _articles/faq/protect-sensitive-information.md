## Can I protect sensitive information of an image from being seen?

If you need to modify an image by concealing certain areas permanently, you can use the [erase()](/_articles/info/api/WebTwain_Edit.md#erase){:target="_blank"} method. This method is particularly useful when the requirement involves replacing a rectangular region within the image with a solid white block.

On the other hand, if you prefer a customizable and removable layer to temporarily conceal particular content, our newly developed Annotation feature is just what you need.
