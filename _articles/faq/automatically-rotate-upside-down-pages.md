# Capture/Image Source

## Can the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK automatically rotate upside-down pages during the document scanning process?

No, the rotation is not automatic, but it can be achieved by leveraging the rotating functionality explained in [this link](/_articles/docs/general-usage/image-processing/image-editing.md#example---rotating-images){:target="_blank"}.

If you need to do automatic skew correction on scanned pages, you can refer to [this article](/_articles/faq/support-image-deskew.md) for our automatic de-skewing feature.
