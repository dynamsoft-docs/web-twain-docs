# Error Troubleshooting

## Syntax error – Unexpected Token "<"

This is usually because the request to load our resources is returning a 404 error.

Please make sure the path to dwt-resources is correct and that you can find \*.viewer.js under the src folder. If it does not exist, please manually copy the Dynamic Web TWAIN resources to that folder.

Please refer to this link for more details on server deployment [Dynamic Web TWAIN Deployment - Server Deployment](/_articles/general-usage/server-deployment.md){:target="_blank"}.
