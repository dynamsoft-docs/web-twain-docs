# SDK Download/Free Trial

## Where can I download an older version of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK?

Visit the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/download" target="_blank">customer portal</a> and go to the Download Center to access older SDK versions. Release notes for current and past stable versions are in the [Stable Releases](/_articles/info/schedule/Stable.md) page.

Dynamsoft provides maintenance and support for each SDK version for two years from its GA date. If you’re on an older release, plan an upgrade to the latest version. Contact <a href="mailto:sales@dynamsoft.com">sales@dynamsoft.com</a> with any questions.
