# SDK Download/Free Trial

## Where can I download an older version of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK?

You can easily work with the older version of Dynamic Web TWAIN by visiting the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/download" target="_blank">customer portal</a> and navigating to Download Center.

Please note that Dynamsoft provides maintenance and support for every version of SDK for TWO years from their general availability date. Therefore, if you are using a very old version, we suggest you schedule an upgrade to the latest version. You can contact <a href="mailto:sales@dynamsoft.com">sales@dynamsoft.com</a> for any questions.
