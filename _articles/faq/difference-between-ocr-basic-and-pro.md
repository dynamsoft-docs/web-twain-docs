## What's the difference between your OCR Basic and OCR Pro SDK?

OCR Basic is built upon the open-source Tesseract OCR engine, where as OCR Pro is built upon a commercial OCR engine. OCR Pro supports more languages and more input and output options. Check <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/cpp-ocr-library/" target="_blank">here</a> for a detailed comparison and the difference in pricing options.

Note that Server-side OCR pro Is no longer supported since version 17.0. And client-side OCR Pro requires a trackable license. The traditional product key no longer works.
