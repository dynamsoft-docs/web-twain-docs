## How to test if your device is SANE compliant?

There are 3 ways to verify whether your scanner is SANE compliant.

* [Recommended & Easiest] Take advantage of our official demo page

  - Open the [demo page](https://demo.dynamsoft.com/dwt/online_demo_scan.aspx) on [Linux]({{site.getstarted}}platform.html#browsers-on-linux)

  > If you haven't installed the SDK, a dialog will show up for you to download and install it.

  - Make sure the scanner driver shows up in the scanner list
