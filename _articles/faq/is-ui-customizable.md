# UI Customization

## Is the UI of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK fully customizable? What cannot be customized?

Most UI is customizable: you can style or replace the viewer, thumbnail viewer, image editor, progress/loading indicators, and the install prompt (via `dynamsoft.webtwain.install.js`, e.g., `Dynamsoft._show_install_dialog`). You can also localize built-in error messages and other labels. What you cannot customize is the native scanner UI itself. See the full guide at [UI Elements and customization](/_articles/extended-usage/ui-customization.md){:target="_blank"}.
