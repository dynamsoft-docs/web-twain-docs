# Licensing and Purchase

## Do I need to purchase a license for my dev or testing environment?

The answer will depend upon the timeframe in which it is used and the environment in which you are testing.
- For ongoing development and testing, you can purchase a license from the online store to cover your usage. If you expect to consume a large volume of scans or browser clients during your dev or testing, please contact us for a discount. 
- For evaluation, you can use the 30-day free trial SDK provided by Dynamsoft. 
- For temporary development and testing, you can contact <a href="mailto:support@dynamsoft.com" target="_blank">support@dynamsoft.com</a> or log into the customer portal to get a 15-day (max. 30 days) temporary license.
