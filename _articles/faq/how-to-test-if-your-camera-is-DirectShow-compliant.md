## How to test if your camera is DirectShow compliant?

- [Recommended] Take advantage of our official demo page

  - Open the <a href="https://demo.dynamsoft.com/DWT/Webcam/online_demo_scan_Webcam.aspx" target="_blank">demo page</a> on <a href="{{site.getstarted}}platform.html#browsers-on-windows" target="_blank">Windows</a> 

  > If you haven't installed the Dynamic Web TWAIN Service, a dialog will show up for you to download and install it.

  - Make sure the camera shows up in the device list

- Try showing the video stream and try capturing a frame to see if it works without any errors

* You can also test with a DirectShow utility such as Amcap (obtainable from third-party sources) to confirm the camera works correctly.
