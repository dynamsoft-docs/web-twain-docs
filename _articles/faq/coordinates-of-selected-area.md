## How to get the coordinates of the selected area on an image?

You can use the [`pageAreaSelected`](/_articles/info/api/WebTwain_Viewer.md#pageareaselected) event to get the coordinates of the selected area on an image. This event is triggered when the user selects an area (draws a rectangle) or moves a selected area on the current page. (Click the link to view syntax and sample usage)
