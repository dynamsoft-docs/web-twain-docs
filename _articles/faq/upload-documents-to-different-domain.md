# Document Saving

## Can I upload documents to a different website domain?

Yes, if your web server is configured to allow cross domain requests. Please check your web server manual for instructions on how to configure it to allow cross domain requests.

If your web server does not allow accessing from a different domain and you are uploading or downloading to/from a web server in a different domain than your current website, you will get a CORS error as described here: [XMLHttpRequest cannot load XXX ](/_articles/faq/XMLHttpRequest-cannot-load.md)
