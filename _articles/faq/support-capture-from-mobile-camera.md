# Capture/Image Source

## Do you support capturing documents from mobile camera?

Starting with Dynamic Web TWAIN v16.0, Dynamsoft has extended the SDK to mobile platforms to help developers easily integrate document capture functionality into mobile web applications. Users can capture images from their built-in camera and edit them in a web viewer on Android or iOS devices without installing any apps. The viewer allows users to manage the document uniformly across desktop and mobile editions.
