## Do you support capturing documents from mobile camera?

While Dynamic Web TWAIN has discontiued its support of using mobile cameras starting from version [18.1](/_articles/info/schedule/stable.html#181-01122023), we are introducing [Mobile Document Scanner](https://www.dynamsoft.com/use-cases/mobile-document-scanner/) for better performance and customizability.
