# Image Viewer

## Where is the image viewer object defined?

By default, Dynamic Web TWAIN has a viewer component that helps to view data available in the buffer. When you [create an instance of Web Twain](/_articles/docs/extended-usage/advanced-initialization.md#instantiating-webtwain-without-onwebtwainready){:target="_blank"}, the viewer is created automatically with its default available settings. You can customize the viewer settings according to your requirements and replace the default viewer with your customized viewer settings.
You can refer to this [link](/_articles/docs/general-usage/viewer-configuration.md#create-the-viewer){:target="_blank"} to read in details about the steps to create/modify the viewer.
