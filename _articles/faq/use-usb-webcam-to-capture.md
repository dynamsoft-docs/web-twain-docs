# Capture/Image Source

## Can I use built-in or USB webcam to capture document?

Yes, you can use either the built-in webcam or a USB-connected webcam to capture documents. To verify if your device supports the DirectShow architecture, you can test it using the [online demo](https://demo.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/camera-scan).
