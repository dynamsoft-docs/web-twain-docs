## What is the earliest iPhone model that your SDK supports?

The earliest version of iOS that the SDK supports is iOS 12. With that in mind, the earliest iPhone model that is supported by iOS 12 is the iPhone 5s. Therefore, technically, the iPhone 5s would be the earliest supported iPhone model (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_12#iPhone" target="_blank">reference link</a>).
