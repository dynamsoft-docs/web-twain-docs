# SDK Download/Free Trial

## Do you provide free trial versions of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK?

Yes. We provide free trial of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK.

You can simply sign up at <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/downloads/" target="_blank">this page</a> to get the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK package with a 30-day free trial license included.
If you have downloaded our SDK from an external website like Github, please note it doesn't come with any free trial license. However, you can still request for a 15-day free trial license at the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense" target="_blank">trial license center</a> in the Dynamsoft's customer portal.

Note: The customer portal would allow you to extend your free trial for up to two times with each extension limited to 15 days.
