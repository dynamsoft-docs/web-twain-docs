## How to scan documents on mobile devices?

> If you are looking to capture documents using mobile cameras, please see FAQ: [Do you support capturing documents from mobile cameras?](/_articles/faq/support-capture-from-mobile-camera.md)


The Dynamic Web TWAIN has introduced a [Remote Scan](https://www.dynamsoft.com/remote-scan/docs/introduction/) feature starting from version [18.2](/_articles/info/schedule/stable.html#remote-scan-1). It allows end users to access scanners of various protocols (TWAIN, SANE, ICA, eSCL, WIA) on the Intranet through any devices and any popular browsers, without any extra software installed.
