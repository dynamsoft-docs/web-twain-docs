# Licensing and Purchase

## Do you offer lifetime/perpetual licenses?



Yes, we offer a lifetime/perpetual license, which typically includes one year of software maintenance service. To receive upgrades and premium technical support, you would need to renew your yearly maintenance. Learn more about [the benefits of maintenance](https://www.dynamsoft.com/company/annual-maintenance/).
