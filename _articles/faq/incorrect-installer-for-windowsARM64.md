# Error Troubleshooting

## Dynamic Web TWAIN prompts the .deb installer for Windows

### Symptom

You may encounter an issue where, on a Windows operating system with ARM64 architecture, you are prompted to download the .deb installer, which is intended for use on Linux operating systems.

### Resolution

The issue was patched in version 17.3.1. We highly recommend upgrading your SDK to version 17.3.1 or higher. Otherwise, you will need to manually install the .MSI installer.
