# Addon

## Is there any way to speed up the barcode reading process?

There are several runtime settings you can use to speed up the barcode reading process:

- Specify the Barcode Type(s) to Read
- Specify maximum barcode count
- Specify a scan Region
- Use the built-in mode 'speed'

For more details on runtime settings, please check [here](/_articles/extended-usage/barcode-processing.md#runtime-settings){:target="_blank"}.

In addition, the size of the image generated during the scanning process also impacts the reading performance. You can check your scanning settings to balance the image qualify and size.
