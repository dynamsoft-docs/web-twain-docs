# Licensing and Purchase

## For the per-client-device licensing model, can seats taken by retired/unused devices be released from the license?

Yes. Occupied license seats will automatically be released if the registered device has not used the SDK feature for 90 days.

<strong>Note</strong> â€“

- For Desktop Service edition, a client device = a client PC (Win/macOS/linux)
- For WebAssembly edition, a client device = a browser client
