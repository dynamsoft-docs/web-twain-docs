# Licensing and Purchase

## For the per-client-device licensing model, can seats taken by retired/unused devices be released from the license?

Yes. Seats tied to a device are automatically released if that device hasn’t used the SDK for 90 days. A client device is simply the end user’s computer (Windows/macOS/Linux).
