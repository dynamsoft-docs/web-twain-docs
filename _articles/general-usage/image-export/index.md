# Exporting Images

> Prerequisite: [DWT Initialization](/_articles/general-usage/initialization.md)

DWT provides a variety of simple methods to export data both externally (uploading to the server) and locally (i.e. within the web application to expose to other web components). DWT provides built-in APIs to support uploading scanned (and otherwise imported) images to the server via both `HTTP` and `FTP`. Locally, DWT can save images to the end user's file system in a many supported file formats. Read on for explanations and examples.
