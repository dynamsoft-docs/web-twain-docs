# Dynamic Web TWAIN's RESTful API

## Overview
Dynamic Web TWAIN (DWT) 18.4 brings forward a new RESTful API allowing developers a new avenue to access scanners across platforms and languages. This allows the Dynamic Web TWAIN Service installed on the scanner host (local or server), to be accessed by desktop, mobile, and server-side applications.

## Sample Implementations
- [Node.js](https://github.com/yushulx/dynamsoft-service-REST-API)
- [Flutter](https://github.com/yushulx/flutter_twain_scanner)
- [Java](https://github.com/tony-xlh/JavaFX-Document-Scanner)
- [Python](https://github.com/yushulx/twain-wia-sane-scanner)
- [.NET](https://github.com/yushulx/dotnet-twain-wia-sane-scanner)

## Prerequisites
- The Dynamic Web TWAIN Service must be installed on the scanner host machine, whether it be a remote PC, server, or local workstation.

## Points to consider
- Using the RESTful API will return pure images as a stream and will not make use of the Dynamic Web TWAIN Viewer. You may instantiate a Viewer in your web application and load the images into the Viewer if you wish.

## REST API Structure
By default, the REST API's host address is set to http://127.0.0.1:18622. This refers back to the local machine. To allow the host machine's scanner to be accessed over the network, the Dynamic Web TWAIN Service on the host machine will need to be configured to allow incoming connections.

| Method | Endpoint	| Description | Parameters | Response |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| GET | /DWTAPI/Scanners | Get a list of scanners | None | 200 OK with scanner list |
| POST | /DWTAPI/ScanJobs | Creates a scan job | `license`, `device`, `config` | 201 Created with job ID |
| GET | /DWTAPI/ScanJobs/:id/NextDocument | Retrieves a document image | id: Job ID | 200 OK with image stream |
| DELETE | /DWTAPI/ScanJobs/:id | Deletes a scan job | id: Job ID | 200 OK |

## How to use
The general workflow to use the RESTful API is as follows:
1. Set DWT license key
2. Initiate ScannerController
3. Declare scanner host IP address
4. Query scanners at scanner host
5. Select scanner
6. Set scan parameters
7. Obtain a scan job via ScannerController
8. Open the data stream to get the images from the host
9. Take the images and display or manipulate as necessary. 

## Syntax

```curl
curl http://127.0.0.1:18622/DWTAPI/Scanners //Get available scanners
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18622/DWTAPI/ScanJobs -d "[post data]" //Creates a scan job and returns the JobId
curl http://127.0.0.1:18622/DWTAPI/ScanJobs/:id/NextDocument -d "[JobId]" //Retrieve Images from JobId
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:18622/DWTAPI/ScanJobs/:id -d "[JobID]" //Delete Scan by JobId
```
