# Image Viewer

## How can I resize the view of image, e.g., zoom in/out the current image?

It will return the or set the zoom factor, and then the current page will be enlarged or reduced. <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/info/api/WebTwain_Viewer.html?ver=latest#zoom" target="_blank">Here</a>, you can find the detail explanations of this property.
