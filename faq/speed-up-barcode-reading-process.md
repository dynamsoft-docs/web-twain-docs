## Is there any way to speed up the barcode reading process?

There are several runtime settings you can use to speed up the barcode reading process:

- Specify the Barcode Type(s) to Read
- Specify maximum barcode count
- Specify a scan Region
- Use the build-in mode ‘speed’

For more details on runtime settings, please check <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/indepth/features/barcode.html?ver=latest#runtime-settings" target="_blank">here</a>.

In addition, the size of the image generated during the scanning process also impacts the reading performance. You can check your scanning settings to balance the image qualify and size.
