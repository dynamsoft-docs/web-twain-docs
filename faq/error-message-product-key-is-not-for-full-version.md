# Error Troubleshooting

## Error message - The current product key is not for full/trial version, please contact the site administrator

You are trying to use a product key full/trial version that does not match with the Dynamsoft Service full/trial version. Please uninstall your local Dynamsoft Service first and access the page again to install the correct version.

Or make sure you have the correct license set in the proper configuration. If you have doubts or questions, you can contact Dynamsoft Support.
