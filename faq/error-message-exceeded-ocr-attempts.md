# Error Troubleshooting

## Error message - You have exceeded the number of OCR attempts allowed by the current license

### Symptom

When you use the OCRPro addon, you may receive this error message returned by the member method <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/info/api/Addon_OCR.html?ver=latest#recognizeselectedimages" target="_blank">GetErrorString()</a> of the OCRResult class.

### Cause

It is a license issue. The OCRPro licenses are yearly licenses and each license has a limitation on the number of pages allowed to be OCR’ed. The SDK will throw this error when the limitation is reached.

### Solution

The license quota has been used up and extra quota needs to be purchased. Contact <a href="mailto:support@dynamsoft.com" target="_blank">Dynamsoft Support</a> for any assistance.
