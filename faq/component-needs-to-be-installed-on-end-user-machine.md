# Is there any component of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK that needs to be installed on end-user machines?

For the <a href="{{site.indepth}}features/initialize.html#desktop-service-edition" target="_blank">Desktop Service Edition</a>, the Dynamic Web TWAIN Service (also called "Dynamsoft Service") needs to be installed on end-user machines. By default end-users will be prompted to install Dynamic Web TWAIN Service when they access your application for the first time.

When you upgrade Dynamic Web TWAIN, you may also need a reinstallation of Dynamic Web TWAIN Service on the client-side. For more information, please refer to <a href="{{site.indepth}}development/upgrade.html#update-dynamsoft-service-on-the-client-side" target="_blank">Update Dynamic Web TWAIN Service on the Client-side</a>.

If you do not want to install anything, there is an option.

You can enable Remote Scan, which scans documents from remote scanners connected to host machines. No installation is required on the client machine. Please check <a href="{{site.faq}}how-to-enable-remote-scan.html" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on how remote scan works and how to enable it.
