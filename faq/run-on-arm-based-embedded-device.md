## Can I run the scanning service on an ARM-based embedded device, such as Raspberry Pi?

Starting from version 17.0, we provide a ARM64 version of the Dynamsoft Service. It can be found in the SDK package of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK. >> <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/downloads/" target="_blank"> Download Center</a>.

So for any ARM64 based devices running on Linux OS, such as Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano, you can also scan documents from physical scanners to the deviceâ€™s browser clients.

MIPS 64-bit version of the Dynamsoft Service is also available in the SDK package, if you need to support any MIPS devices.
