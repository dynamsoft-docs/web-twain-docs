## Can I encrypt all documents in PDF format before uploading?

While we do not support encrypting documents in PDF format before uploading, you can use other tools to encrypt the PDF documents before loading them.

We support loading encrypted pdf files by using the API <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/info/api/Addon_PDF.html?ver=latest#setpassword" target="_blank">SetPassword</a>, which sets the password needed to open the encrypted PDF files.

> Note - This method needs to be called before importing a PDF into the viewer.
