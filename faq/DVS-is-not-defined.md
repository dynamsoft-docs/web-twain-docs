# Error Troubleshooting

## Uncaught ReferenceError - DVS is not defined

There is a non-existent variable referenced somewhere, usually because it fails to load our resources.

Please make sure the path to Resources folder is correct and that you can find \*.viewer.js under the srcolder. If it does not exist, please manually copy the Dynamic Web TWAIN resources to that folder.

Please refer to this link for more details on server deployment <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/indepth/deployment/server.html" target="_blank">Dynamic Web TWAIN Deployment - Server Deployment</a>
