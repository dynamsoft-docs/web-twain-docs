# Licensing and Purchase

## Do you have any local resellers from whom I can purchase a license of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK?

Yes. To see if there is an authorized local reseller, please go to <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/partner/resellers/" target="_blank">this page</a>. If you canâ€™t find an appropriate one from the list, you can contact your preferred local reseller and have them email reseller@dynamsoft.com for quick registration. The registration process takes 1 - 3 business days. Or, <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/company/contact/" target="_blank">contact us</a> so we can work it out.
