## How can I extend my free trial

You can extend your trial license by logging into the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/index" target="_blank">customer portal</a> and go to the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense" target="_blank">trial license center</a>. The customer portal would allow you to extend your trial for maximum three times with each extension limited to 15 days.

If you need longer period of trial license, please send your project requirement and timeline to <a href="mailto:support@dynamsoft.com" >support@dynamsoft.com</a>. You can also contact our support team via the online chat service available on our website.
