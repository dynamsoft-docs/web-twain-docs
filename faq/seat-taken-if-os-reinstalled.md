# Licensing and Purchase

## Would a client machine take one more license seat if its operating system is reinstalled?

When a client device is licensed, a random UUID is issued to the client device. Reinstalling the device OS would erase the UUID, so if the device accesses the SDK feature again, it will take a new UUID â€“ i.e. a new license seat will be taken.

However, if an UUID has no usage of the SDK for consecutive 90 days, the license seat taken by the UUID would be automatically released. Furthermore, our Per-Client-Device license allows you to overuse no more than additional 10% of the purchased device quota, which helps relief your concern on any misuse or device reinstallation. For example, if you purchase a license for 100 client devices, you can actually license 110 devices.
