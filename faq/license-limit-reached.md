# Licensing and Purchase

## What if I reach the limit of the granted number of license seats?

For Per Client Device or Per Page licensing model, we offer some additional quota at no cost in case you canâ€™t extend or expand the license in time. Please refer to <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/license-server/docs/about/terms.html#grace-stage" target="_blank">Grace Stage</a>. To avoid running out of licensed seats suddenly, Dynamsoft automatically send notification emails to licensees about the status of the license. Please refer to <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/license-server/docs/common/usagealerts.html" target="_blank">Usage Alerts</a>.

For other licensing model, please refer to the contract or agreement you signed or contact your account manager for help.
