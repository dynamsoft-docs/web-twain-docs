# Licensing and Purchase

## Is internet connectivity required to use any license?

No it is not mandatory, but different licensing options leverage different techniques.
Generally, you need to use a license server program to distribute your purchased license seats to specified devices.

Option #1: Connect to a license server hosted by Dynamsoft
Dynamsoft has the license server hosted on Amazon’s AWS. If your device can connect to the internet, you can easily license your devices this way. <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/license-tracking/docs/dshosting/index.html" target="_blank">More Detail ></a>

Option #2: Host the license server program on your own server machine
By hosting the license server internally, all your devices can get licensed via your intranet. This is suggested if you don’t allow internet connection of your devices. <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/license-tracking/docs/selfhosting/index.html?ver=latest" target="_blank">More Detail ></a>

More option:
If neither option is desired, we can also provide a non-tracking offline license with a trust-based agreement signed by both parties. Please <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/company/contact/" target="_blank">contact us</a> to discuss it.
