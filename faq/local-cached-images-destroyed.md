## When would the local cached images be destroyed?

Dynamic Web TWAIN introduced a disk caching feature to allow saving image data to the local disk.

The disk caching feature is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/info/api/WebTwain_Buffer.html?ver=latest#ifallowlocalcache" target="_blank">IfAllowLocalCache</a> to false. You can also set how much memory DWT can use before images start to be cached. By default, 800MB is used. You can change it using the property <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/info/api/WebTwain_Buffer.html?ver=latest#buffermemorylimit" target="_blank">BufferMemoryLimit</a>.

All cached data is encrypted, can only be accessed by Dynamic Web TWAIN, and is destroyed when Dynamic Web TWAIN is unloaded. If the SDK exists unexpectedly, all cached data will also be destroyed.
