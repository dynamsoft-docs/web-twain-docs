# Image Editing

## Is there undo functionality?

No, we donâ€™t have an undo functionality while the user tries to edit an image because it may not be easy to achieve step-by-step undo with our SDK. However, we do offer a restore changes functionality inside of an image editor, before saving any changes that were made. But our advice would be to save the image/images first before editing and then if you want to revert, you can simply load the previously saved version in case of any mistakes made while editing.
