# Capture/Image Source

## Can the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK automatically rotate upside-down pages during the document scanning process?

No, the rotation is not automatic, but it can be achieved by leveraging the rotating functionality explained in <a href="{{site.general-usage}}image-processing/image-editing.html#example---rotating-images" target="_blank">this link</a>.

If you need to do automatic skew correction on scanned pages, you can refer to [this article]({{site.faq}}support-image-deskew.html) for our automatic de-skewing feature.
