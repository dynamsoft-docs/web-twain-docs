## Can the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK automatically rotate upside-down pages during the document scanning process?

No, the rotation is not automatic, but it can be achieved by leveraging the rotating functionality explained in <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/indepth/features/edit.html?ver=latest#rotating-flipping-and-mirroring" target="_blank">this link</a>.

By the way, if you need to do automatic skew correct on scanned pages, you can refer to [this article]({{site.faq}}support-image-deskew.html) for our automatic de-skewing feature.
