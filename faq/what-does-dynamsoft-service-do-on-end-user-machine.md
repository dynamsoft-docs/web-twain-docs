# Project Deployment and End-user Installation

## What does the Dynamsoft Service do on the end-user machine?

Dynamsoft Service is required for the Desktop Service Edition of Dynamic Web TWAIN. Itâ€™s a background system service that handles the communication between connected physical devices and the browser, as well as image processing, encoding, decoding, etc.

Dynamsoft Service sets up a local HTTP service that accepts requests from JavaScript code running in the browser and performs operations accordingly. The following are a few examples.
