# SDK Download/ Free Trial

## Is the free trial version fully functional?

Yes. The free trial version of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK is fully functional. In other word, there is no feature limitation with the free trial version except that the trial SDK comes with an expiration date.

Also, please note the trial version includes all core modules as well as addon modules (e.g., barcode reader, PDF Rasterizer, etc.) of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK. Once you install the free trial version, you can generally find the resources and samples about core and addons under C:\Program Files (x86)\Dynamsoft\Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK\
