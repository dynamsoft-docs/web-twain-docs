## What is the difference between Camera.play and Camera.showVideo?

`Camera.showVideo` is a built-in feature to handle camera capturing, prospective adjusting, etc. It supports two available modes: document and picture.

`Camera.play` is a more specific API for starting streaming video from the current camera.

Note that these two APIs cannot be mixed with each other.

Please check <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/info/api/Addon_Camera.html?ver=latest" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on the Camera APIs.
