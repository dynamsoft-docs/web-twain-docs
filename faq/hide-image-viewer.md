## Can I hide the Dynamsoft image viewer and use my own image viewer?

If you want to use the viewer, you can use <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/indepth/features/initialize.html?ver=latest#-dynamsoftdwtcreatedwtobjectex-" target="_blank">Dynamsoft.DWT.CreateDWTObjectEx()</a> to create a WebTwain instance that doesnâ€™t come with a viewer.
You can also unbind the viewer by using the steps mentioned <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/indepth/features/viewer.html?ver=latest#bind-the-viewer" target="_blank">here</a>.
