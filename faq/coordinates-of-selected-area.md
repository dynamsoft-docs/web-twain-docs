## How to get the coordinates of the selected area on an image?

You can use the pageAreaSelected event to get the coordinates of the selected area on an image. This event is triggered when the user selects an area (draws a rectangle) or moves a selected area on the current page. You can visit <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/info/api/WebTwain_Viewer.html?ver=latest#pageareaselected" target="_blank">link</a> to get syntax and examples of pageAreaSelected event.
