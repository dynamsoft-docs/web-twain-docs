## How to get the coordinates of the selected area on an image?

You can use the [`pageAreaSelected`]({{site.api}}WebTwain_Viewer.html#pageareaselected) event to get the coordinates of the selected area on an image. This event is triggered when the user selects an area (draws a rectangle) or moves a selected area on the current page. (Click the link to view syntax and sample usage)
