# Initialize

Initializing `DWT` takes a few simple steps, as you have seen in the ["Getting Started"]({{site.getstarted}}helloworld.html)chapter. The following guide will dive deeper into how `DWT` is intialized once the page loads.

## Usage Modes

Before we dive into the details of initialization, let's take a look at the two modes in which `DWT` can operate:

### Service Mode

#### What is Service Mode

Service mode means `DWT` operates through the [Dynamsoft Service]({{site.indpeth}}deployment/Service.html) which is a quiet, background system service that handles the communication between connected devices and the browser client as well as imaging processing, encoding, decoding, etc.

When using `DWT` on [desktop]({{site.getstarted}}platform.html#browsers-on-desktop-devices), the user by default will be using service mode (recommended). That means, the installation of the Dynamsoft Service is mandatory.

#### Installation of the Dynamsoft Service

If a user who hasn't installed the Dynamsoft Service accesses the web page (which has `DWT` ) for the first time, they will be prompted to install it. This is a built-in behaviour of the library. The prompt will display the download link, and once the installer is downloaded, the installation process will take just a few seconds.

> The prompt comes up when you try to [create a `WebTwain` instance](#creating-the-webtwain-instance) in service mode. The same prompt will appear regardless of whether the client OS is Windows, macOS or Linux However the file you download changes based on your operating system. On Windows and macOS, the users can double click the downloaded installer to install the SDK. On Linux, however, the users will need to run one of the following commands to install it
>
> Debian / Ubuntu: 
> ``` 
> sudo dpkg -i DynamsoftServiceSetup.deb
> ```
> Fedora
> ``` 
> sudo rpm -ivh DynamsoftServiceSetup.rpm
> ```

Once the installation is done, you can click 'Reconnect to the service' or refresh the page to start using the SDK.

### WASM Mode

#### What is WASM Mode

WASM mode means `DWT` operates completely within the browser with the help of `Web Worker` and `WebAssembly` . It relieves users from manually installing anything but it does require advanced features that only modern [WASM browsers]({{site.getstarted}}platform.html#wasm-browsers) provide.

If a user decides to access the `DWT` application via [a mobile browser]({{site.getstarted}}platform.html#browsers-on-mobile-devices) or they don't want to install anything on [desktop]({{site.getstarted}}platform.html#browsers-on-desktop-devices), they can choose the WASM mode.

Read more on how to [expand your application to mobile platforms]({{site.indepth}}development/upgrade.html#expand-your-application-to-mobile-platforms).

#### Comparison of the two modes

A major difference between Service mode and WASM mode is that the latter can not access local devices, which means that it is impossible to [use local scanners]({{site.indepth}}features/input.html#scan-from-a-local-scanner).

Also, the performance and speed of WASM mode is not as good as Service mode because it is not able to make use of as many resources.

At Dynamsoft, we tried and are still trying to make these two modes to function as closely to each other as possible. 

#### How to use WASM mode on desktop

As mentioned previously, [desktop]({{site.getstarted}}platform.html#browsers-on-desktop-devices) users will by default go with service mode, while mobile and tablet users will default to WASM mode. However, if you would like desktop users to start in WASM mode and forego the need for a service, you can set [UseLocalService]({{site.info}}api/Dynamsoft_WebTwainEnv.html#uselocalservice) to false in the intialization code.

## Loading the Core JS Files

This is the first step of the initialization.

### Introduction to the core files

Inside the `Resources` directory that is included with the SDK installation, you will find the following files:

``` 
dynamsoft.webtwain.config.js
dynamsoft.webtwain.initiate.js
```

These two files are the main JavaScript files that define the configuration and operation of `DWT` . Let's break down each file's purpose:

* `dynamsoft.webtwain.initiate.js`
This file is the **core** of the `DWT` JavaScript Library. You're not supposed to change it without consulting the [Dynamsoft Support Team]({{site.about}}Getsupport.html). 

* `dynamsoft.webtwain.config.js`
This file is used for basic configuration of `DWT` . Here is where you configure the product key, change the initial viewer size, and more.

### Questions

#### Q: Does it matter which JavaScript file is referenced first

**A**: Generally, both `dynamsoft.webtwain.initiate.js` and `dynamsoft.webtwain.config.js` need to be referenced. In the former file, it detects whether the latter has been loaded, if not, it'll wait. Therefore, it doesn't matter which file comes first.

#### Q: Why do I see `dynamsoft.webtwain.min.js` and `dynamsoft.webtwain.min.mjs` instead of the 2 files above

**A**: The two files are present in the official [npm package `dwt` ](https://github.com/dynamsoft-dwt/web-twain-package) . For simplicity, in each of these files Dynamsoft has included all necessary JavaScript code which includes both files mentioned above plus `dynamsoft.webtwain.install.js` and all extra components (add-ons). The ".js" file is a simple combination of the code while the ".mjs" file is built as an ECMAScript 6 (ES6) Module that is used in applications based on `Angular` , `React` and `Vue` , etc.

In a regular application, referencing `dynamsoft.webtwain.min.js` alone would be more than enough than referencing `dynamsoft.webtwain.config.js` and `dynamsoft.webtwain.initiate.js` . 

## Loading Add-on JS files

`DWT` offers a number of add-ons, including a barcode reader, a PDF rasterizer, two webcam utilizers and two OCR engines. The files for these components reside in the `addon` subfolder in the `Resources` directory. Check out more [here]({{site.about}}faqs.html#what-are-the-resources-files).

Whether or not to include any of these components is as simple as referencing its respective JavaScript file. Once a JavaScript file is referenced, the member methods/properties of that component are made available in the [Dynamsoft Namespace](#the-dynamsoft-namespace) and can later be used by `WebTwain` instances.

> As mentioned above, if you use any of the `min` file from the `dwt` package, all add-on components are included by default.

## Loading the supporting files

Once the main JavaScript files are loaded in, the initialization process now moves to loading all the other supporting JS files as well as the CSS files. Depending on the mode `DWT` operates in, the supporting files vary.

### Service mode files

Service mode requires the following files found inside the `Resources` folder:

``` 
dynamsoft.webtwain.install.js
src/dynamsoft.viewer.js
src/dynamsoft.viewer.css
src/dynamsoft.webtwain.css
```

* `dynamsoft.webtwain.install.js`
This file is used to configure the dialogs which show up when the Dynamsoft Service is not installed or needs to be upgraded, etc. This file is automatically loaded when the code in `dynamsoft.webtwain.initiate.js` executes. Therefore, it does not need to be referenced in the HTML page.

> As mentioned above, if you use any of the `min` file from the `dwt` package, this `install` file is already included.

* `dynamsoft.viewer.js` , `dynamsoft.viewer.css` and `dynamsoft.webtwain.css`
These three files are used to build the viewer component of `DWT` , as well as define the css of the other UI elements of the library.

### WASM-specific files

Apart from the 4 files that the service mode requires, the WASM mode also needs the following files

``` 
dynamsoft.imageio.js
dynamsoft.imageio_wasm-<version number>.js
dynamsoft.imagecore-<version number>.wasm
dynamsoft.imageio-<version number>.wasm
dynamsoft.imageProc-<version number>.wasm

dynamsoft.pdfReader-<version number>.wasm
dynamsoft.pdfWriter-<version number>.wasm
```

The first five files in the above list contain functionalities for image IO (decoding and encoding included). The last two files contain functionalities for PDF reading & writing.

> These 7 files are loaded only when the first `WebTwain` instance in WASM mode is created.

#### Questions

##### Q: Are all 7 files mentioned above used exclusively in WASM mode

**A**: No, the library will use the WASM files even in service mode when one of the following conditions is met

* The APIs for the [ `WebTwain.Addon.Camera` ]({{site.info}}api/Addon_Camera.html) component are called. 
* The APIs [ `WebTwain.Viewer.showVideo()` ]({{site.info}}api/Addon_Camera.html#showvideo) or [ `WebTwain.Viewer.closeVideo()` ]({{site.info}}api/Addon_Camera.html#closevideo) are called.

## Creating the WebTwain instance

This is the last step of the initialization.

The leading player of `DWT` is the `WebTwain` "class". Almost all methods and properties are defined in this "class". As [mentioned previously](#installation-of-the-dynamsoft-service), creating a `WebTwain` instance in Service mode requires a successful connection to the Dynamsoft Service. On the other hand, creating a `WebTwain` instance in WASM mode requires these [extra files](#wasm-specific-files).

Read on to learn the three methods to instantiate `DWT` .

### [ `Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.Load` ]({{site.info}}api/Dynamsoft_WebTwainEnv.html#load)

This is the default method to create `WebTwain` instances. 

#### Questions

##### Q: Can this method create a `WebTwain` instance that does not come with a default viewer

**A**: No, only [ `CreateDWTObjectEx` ](#dynamsoftwebtwainenvcreatedwtobjectex) can do that.

##### Q: Can this method be used alongside [Load](#-dynamsoftwebtwainenvload-)

**A**: Yes, this method can create more `WebTwain` instances after  [Load](#-dynamsoftwebtwainenvload-) has created the initial one.

##### Q: How do I use this method to create `WebTwain` instances without using [Load](#-dynamsoftwebtwainenvload-)

**A**: [Load](#-dynamsoftwebtwainenvload-) is called automatically if `Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.AutoLoad` is set to `true` . Therefore, to ignore [Load](#-dynamsoftwebtwainenvload-), `Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.AutoLoad` must be set to `false` .

##### Q: How do I use `CreateDWTObject`

**A**: This method has the following syntax

``` javascript
/**
 * Create a WebTwain instance with UI.
 * @param ContainerId Specify the HTML element (typically of the type HTMLDivElement) to hold the UI.
 * @param host Specify the host.
 * @param port Specify the port.
 * @param portSSL Specify the SSL port.
 * @param successCallback A callback function that is executed if the request succeeds.
 * @param failureCallback A callback function that is executed if the request fails.
 */
CreateDWTObject(
    ContainerId: string,
    host ? : string,
    port ? : string | number,
    portSSL ? : string | number,
    successCallBack: (DWObject: WebTwain) => void,
    failureCallBack: (errorString: string) => void
): void;
```

The following would be equivalent to using [Load](#-dynamsoftwebtwainenvload-) with the configuration `Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.Containers = [{ContainerId: 'dwtcontrolContainer', Width: '585px', Height: '513px'}`

``` javascript
Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.CreateDWTObject(
    'dwtcontrolContainer',
    function(obj) {
        obj.Width = 585;
        obj.Height = 513;
    },
    function(err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
);
```

The method can also do something that [Load](#-dynamsoftwebtwainenvload-) can't. The following code creates a `WebTwain` instance that connects to the Dynamsoft Service running on another machine with the IP 192.168.8.221 and ports 18622 and 18623 (SSL)

> NOTE that [ `Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.UseLocalService` ]({{site.info}}api/Dynamsoft_WebTwainEnv.html#uselocalservice) must be `true` for this usage.

``` javascript
Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.UseLocalService = true;
Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.CreateDWTObject(
    'dwtcontrolContainer',
    "192.168.8.221",
    "18622", "18623"
    function(obj) {},
    function(err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
);
```

### [ `Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.CreateDWTObjectEx` ]({{site.info}}api/Dynamsoft_WebTwainEnv.html#createdwtobjectex)

This method manually creates a `WebTwain` instance without a default built-in viewer.

#### Questions

##### Q: Can this method be used alongside [Load](#-dynamsoftwebtwainenvload-)

**A**: Yes, same as  [ `CreateDWTObject` ](#dynamsoftwebtwainenvcreatedwtobject).

##### Q: How do I use this method to create `WebTwain` instances without using [Load](#-dynamsoftwebtwainenvload-)

**A**: Same as  [ `CreateDWTObject` ](#dynamsoftwebtwainenvcreatedwtobject).

##### Q: How to use `CreateDWTObjectEx`

**A**: This method has the following syntax

``` typescript
/**
 * Create a WebTwain instance without UI.
 * @param WebTwainId Specify the Id of the instance.
 * @param successCallback A callback function that is executed if the request succeeds.
 * @param failureCallback A callback function that is executed if the request fails.
*/
CreateDWTObjectEx(
    dwtInitialConfig: DWTInitialConfig,
    successCallBack: (DWObject: WebTwain) => void,
    failureCallBack: (errorString: string) => void
): void;
```

The following is the interface `DWTInitialConfig`

``` typescript
interface DWTInitialConfig {
    WebTwainId: string;
    Host?: string;
    Port?: string;
    SSLPort?: string;
}
```

Compared with [ `CreateDWTObject` ](#dynamsoftwebtwainenvcreatedwtobject), `CreateDWTObjectEx` requires a `WebTwainId` instead of a `ContainerId` .

The following would be equivalent to using [Load](#-dynamsoftwebtwainenvload-) with the configuration `Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.Containers = [{ContainerId: 'dwtcontrolContainer', Width: '585px', Height: '513px'}`
> NOTE that the created instance doesn't have a built-in viewer but instead used the method [ `BindViewer()` ]({{site.info}}api/WebTwain_Viewer.html#bindviewer) to add a viewer.

``` javascript
Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.CreateDWTObjectEx({
        WebTwainId: 'dwtcontrolContainer'
    },
    function(obj) {
        obj.BindViewer('dwtcontrolContainer', {
            Height: 513,
            Width: 585
        });
    },
    function(err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
);
```

Similar to [ `CreateDWTObject` ](#dynamsoftwebtwainenvcreatedwtobject), `CreateDWTObjectEx` can also connect to the Dynamsoft Service running on another machine

> NOTE that `Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.UseLocalService` must be `true` for this usage.

``` javascript
Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.UseLocalService = true;
Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.CreateDWTObjectEx({
        WebTwainId: 'dwtcontrolContainer1',
        Host: "192.168.8.221",
        Port: "18622",
        SSLPort: "18623"
    },
    function(obj) {},
    function(err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
);
```

## The Dynamsoft Namespace

`DWT` operates under the Dynamsoft namespace. We'll briefly introduce it.

`Dynamsoft` is the top-level namespace. `DWT` and other Dynamsoft libraries are all defined under `Dynamsoft` . For `DWT` , the major members of this namespace are

* [ `WebTwainEnv` ]({{site.info}}api/Dynamsoft_WebTwainEnv.html)
    Includes global methods, properties to help with `WebTwain` initialization and instantiation, etc. as shown in previous context.

* `Lib`
    Includes information like environment detection results ( `Dynamsoft.Lib.env` ) and global methods like `showMask()` , `hideMask()` , etc.

* `Enumerations`
    Example: [ `Dynamsoft.EnumDWT_PixelType` ]({{site.info}}api/Dynamsoft_Enum.html#dynamsoftenumdwt_pixeltype)
