## How to test if your camera is DirectShow compliant

- [Recommended] Take advantage of our official demo page

  - Open the [demo page](https://demo.dynamsoft.com/DWT/Webcam/online_demo_scan_Webcam.aspx) on [Windows]({{site.getstarted}}platform.html#browsers-on-windows)

  > If you haven't installed the SDK, a dialog will show up for you to download and install it.

  - Make sure the camera shows up in the device list

- Try showing the video stream and try capturing a frame to see if it works without any errors

* Try the camera with the [Amcap app](https://tst.dynamsoft.com/public/download/tools/amcap.zip) and see if it works correctly.
