# License

## The current product key does not match the domain

* Symptom

When you visit a `Dynamic Web TWAIN` application , you may be met with this error message.

* Cause

To protect your license, you can bind it to your domain. When you do this, you must make sure your application is deployed to the bound domain, otherwise you will receive the error.

* Resolution

Make sure you deployed the application to the domain bound to your license or add the domain to your license bindings by contacting [Dynamsoft Support]({{site.about}}getsupport.html).
