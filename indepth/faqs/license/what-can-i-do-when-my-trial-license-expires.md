## What can I do when my trial license expires? 

Dynamic Web TWAIN comes with a 30-day free trial license from the day the software is installed with the Official installer. After that, a developer can extend the trial twice on [this page](https://www.dynamsoft.com/company/docs/customer-portal/trial-license.html?ver=latest#request-a-trial-extension).
