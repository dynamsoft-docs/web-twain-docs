# Distribution and Deployment

## Does installation require administrator rights? 

Yes, the installer is a `.msi` file which requires administrator rights. If your organization doesn't allow end users to have admin rights, you can contact [Dynamsoft Support]({{site.about}}getsupport.html) to get a special "Personal Installer" that doesn't require admin rights.

> NOTE
>  
> Once Dynamsoft Service is installed with admin rights, every user on that machine can use it. On the other hand, if it is installed with a "Personal Installer", only that specific user can use it.
