# Development

## Is the Image Editor compatible across all platforms

Yes, the Image Editor is availabe on all platforms where `Dynamic Web TWAIN` is supported. However, while it is built into the browser page in most cases, it is invoked by a different API and runs as a separate programme if `Dynamic Web TWAIN` ActiveX edition is used. Contact [Dynamsoft Support]({{site.about}}getsupport.html) to learn more.
