## What is a LicenseChecker

The `LicenseChecker` is a server-side script that tracks the usage of the license. It's required by `OCRPro` . For more info, please check out [OCRPro License Tracking Mechanism](https://tst.dynamsoft.com/public/docs/ocr/OCRPRO-LICENSE-TRACKING-MECHANISM.pdf).

Also check out [License Checker for OCRPro]({{site.indepth}}development/serverscript.md#license-checker-for-ocrpro) on how to write the server side script.
