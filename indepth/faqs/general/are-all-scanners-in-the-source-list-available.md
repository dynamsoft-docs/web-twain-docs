# General

## Are all scanners in the source list available? 

No. Although some smart scanner drivers will hide themselves when the scanners are unplugged, most scanner drivers still show up even if the scanners are no longer hooked. This is something Dynamic Web TWAIN can not control. Therefore, please make sure a device is connected before you try to use it.
