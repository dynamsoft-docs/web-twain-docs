# General

## What are the most common issues when clients start to use my scan application? 

When end clients visit your scan page for the first time on a desktop, they will be automatically asked to download and manually install the Dynamsoft Service. 

Make sure the clients are aware of this. Dynamic Web TWAIN is NOT the scanner driver. Instead, it works with scanners via their own vendor-developed drivers. Make sure the proper driver is installed and the scanner itself already works on the system before attempting to use it with Dynamic Web TWAIN.
