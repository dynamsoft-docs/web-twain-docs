# Support ARM64 or MIPS64 based computers

In V17, we added support for 64-bit ARM & MIPS64 based computers. However, the corresponding service installer is not available in the official package. 

To support your ARM64 or MIPS64 users, please contact [Dynamsoft Support]({{site.about}}getsupport.html) to get the service installer package for ARM64 or MIPS64.
