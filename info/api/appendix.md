* The following APIs in v16.2 are improved based on old APIs in v16.1-.

  + [`Viewer.setViewMode()`]({{site.info}}api/WebTwain_Viewer.html#setviewmode)

    It also accepts the values "-1, -1" which is equivalent to setting `Viewer.singlePageMode` to `true` .

  + [`Viewer.updateUISettings()`]({{site.info}}api/WebTwain_Viewer.html#updateuisettings)

* The following APIs are also deprecated in v16.2

  + `SetViewMode()`

    Use Viewer.setViewMode() instead.

* The following APIs from v16.1- are removed

  + `Viewer.bOnlyShowThumbnailsView`
  + `Viewer.cursorOverThumbnailsView`
  + `Viewer.bindCustomElement()`
  + `Viewer.showCustomElement()`
  + `Viewer.hideCustomElement()`
  + `Viewer.toggleCustomElement()`
  + `Viewer.setSelectedImageArea()`
  + `Viewer.zoomIn()`
  + `Viewer.zoomOut()`

* The following APIs in v16.1- are implemented differently in v16.2  
  + `BindViewer()` with two parameters
  + `UpdateViewer()`

  The two methods above were used to set the size of the viewer or to show the thumbnail viewer. In v16, 2, different APIs are used as shown below:

``` javascript
  /* Set the size of the viewer */
  DWObject.Viewer.height = 800;
  DWObject.Viewer.width = 600;
  /* Create a thumbnail viewer, note that this viewer can be hidden or disposed */
  var objThumbnailViewer = DWObject.Viewer.createThumbnailViewer(thumbnailViewerSettings);
  objThumbnailViewer.show();
  //objThumbnailViewer.hide();
  //objThumbnailViewer.dispose();
  /* updateViewMode() is used to change only the view mode of the thumbnail viewer */
  objThumbnailViewer.updateViewMode(viewMode: ViewMode);
  /* The following two are used to hook or unhook events to the thumbnail viewer */
  objThumbnailViewer.on()
  objThumbnailViewer.off()
```

  + `ShowImageEditor()`

  While this method still works, it's deprecated and the alternative is shown in the code below

``` javascript
  /* The image editor is now created on the fly and can be hidden or disposed */
  var objImageEditor = DWObject.Viewer.createImageEditor(editorSettings);
  objImageEditor.show();
  objImageEditor.hide();
  objImageEditor.dispose();
```

  + `Viewer.bindCustomElement()`
  + `Viewer.showCustomElement()`
  + `Viewer.hideCustomElement()`
  + `Viewer.toggleCustomElement()`

  As already mentioned, these four methods are removed and the alternative implementation is shown in the code below

``` javascript
  var objCustomElement = DWObject.Viewer.createCustomElement(document.getElementById("divCustomElement"));
  objCustomElement.show();
  objCustomElement.hide();
  objCustomElement.dispose();
```
