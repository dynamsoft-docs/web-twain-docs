# Importing Images

DWT can import images in a few different ways, the most common which is to acquire images from image sources, which are scanners and other imaging hardware. This section goes over [working with imaging devices]({{site.general-usage}}image-import/scanner-image-acquisition.html). we can also load image files, both from the local file system and over the network, as explained [here]({{site.general-usage}}image-import/file-import.html). In this section, we demonstrate how to quickly set up a web application to take advantage of each of these basic use cases for DWT.
